# Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to explore the different analysis of integration test data using reliability assessment tools. Two methods exist for evaluating failure data:1) Reliability growth testing 2) Reliability assessment using Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC). With the use of these tools, it is possible to evaluate a hypothetical system's dependability using failure information gathered during integration testing. Also, it would be possible to measure the failure rate, MTTF and reliability of the SUT through analyzing the test data.

1) Reliability growth testing - C-SFRAT
By testing and analysis, reliability growth testing helps to increase a system's dependability. Testing for reliability growth aims to find and remove failure-causing factors while also raising the system's overall reliability.
The methodology is applied to crucial subsystems within a larger system in the context of C-SFRAT reliability growth testing, using fault-tree analysis to identify possible failures and their causes. Then, these subsystems are tested and made more reliable using the reliability growth testing procedure.

2) Reliability assessment using Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC)
A graphical tool called a reliability demonstration chart (RDC) is used in reliability engineering to show that a system or product satisfies a given reliability criterion. During reliability testing, the RDC is utilised to monitor the frequency of failures over time and to contrast the observed failure rate with the desired failure rate.
The RDC normally consists of a graph with two axes: the horizontal axis displays the cumulative test time or test unit count, and the vertical axis displays the cumulative number of failures. The reliability requirement line, which represents the required dependability level as a horizontal line on the graph, is also included.
Failures are noted and displayed on the RDC during testing. The product or system is deemed to have met the reliability requirement if the measured failure rate is below the reliability requirement line. More testing or design modifications can be required to increase the dependability of the system or product if the reported failure rate is higher than the reliability requirement line.

# A discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of reliability growth analysis
A technique called reliability growth analysis is used to monitor and enhance a system's or product's reliability over time. To predict future failure rates and increase reliability, it entails gathering data on errors and the corrective measures that were done.

Advantages of reliability growth analysis:
1) Early on in the product development process, it assists in identifying and addressing potential problems, which can help save time and resources.
2) It enables ongoing product optimisation and enhancement by monitoring failure rates over time.
3) It offers insightful information on a system's or product's dependability, which can guide choices regarding warranties, maintenance schedules, and other crucial aspects.
4) It can assist firms in fulfilling safety and dependability regulatory standards.

Disadvantages of reliability growth analysis:
1) The process of gathering and processing the required data can be time- and resource-consuming.
2) To effectively evaluate the data, one must have a good level of statistical knowledge.
3) It might not be suitable for all systems or products, especially those with extremely low failure rates or complicated failure modes.
4) It is predicated on the idea that remedial measures will genuinely increase reliability, which may or may not be the case.
