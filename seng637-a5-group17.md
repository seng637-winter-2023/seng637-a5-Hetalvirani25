# Introduction

The purpose of this lab is to explore the different analysis of integration test data using reliability assessment tools. Two methods exist for evaluating failure data:1) Reliability growth testing 2) Reliability assessment using Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC). With the use of these tools, it is possible to evaluate a hypothetical system's dependability using failure information gathered during integration testing. Also, it would be possible to measure the failure rate, MTTF and reliability of the SUT through analyzing the test data.

1) Reliability growth testing - C-SFRAT
By testing and analysis, reliability growth testing helps to increase a system's dependability. Testing for reliability growth aims to find and remove failure-causing factors while also raising the system's overall reliability.
The methodology is applied to crucial subsystems within a larger system in the context of C-SFRAT reliability growth testing, using fault-tree analysis to identify possible failures and their causes. Then, these subsystems are tested and made more reliable using the reliability growth testing procedure.

2) Reliability assessment using Reliability Demonstration Chart (RDC)
A graphical tool called a reliability demonstration chart (RDC) is used in reliability engineering to show that a system or product satisfies a given reliability criterion. During reliability testing, the RDC is utilised to monitor the frequency of failures over time and to contrast the observed failure rate with the desired failure rate.
The RDC normally consists of a graph with two axes: the horizontal axis displays the cumulative test time or test unit count, and the vertical axis displays the cumulative number of failures. The reliability requirement line, which represents the required dependability level as a horizontal line on the graph, is also included.
Failures are noted and displayed on the RDC during testing. The product or system is deemed to have met the reliability requirement if the measured failure rate is below the reliability requirement line. More testing or design modifications can be required to increase the dependability of the system or product if the reported failure rate is higher than the reliability requirement line.

# A discussion on decision making given a target failure rate

# A discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of reliability growth analysis
A technique called reliability growth analysis is used to monitor and enhance a system's or product's reliability over time. To predict future failure rates and increase reliability, it entails gathering data on errors and the corrective measures that were done.

Advantages of reliability growth analysis:
1) Early on in the product development process, it assists in identifying and addressing potential problems, which can help save time and resources.
2) It enables ongoing product optimisation and enhancement by monitoring failure rates over time.
3) It offers insightful information on a system's or product's dependability, which can guide choices regarding warranties, maintenance schedules, and other crucial aspects.
4) It can assist firms in fulfilling safety and dependability regulatory standards.

Disadvantages of reliability growth analysis:
1) The process of gathering and processing the required data can be time- and resource-consuming.
2) To effectively evaluate the data, one must have a good level of statistical knowledge.
3) It might not be suitable for all systems or products, especially those with extremely low failure rates or complicated failure modes.
4) It is predicated on the idea that remedial measures will genuinely increase reliability, which may or may not be the case.

# A discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of RDC
In engineering and product development, reliability demonstration charts—also called reliability growth charts—are frequently used to monitor a product's reliability over time. These graphs can offer insightful information on a product's dependability and aid in the early detection of potential faults. Yet, employing dependability demonstration charts has both benefits and drawbacks.

Advantages:
1) Predictive tool
2) Improvement tracking
3) Communication
4) Data visualization

Disadvantages:
1) Limited scope
2) Limited accuracy
3) Subjectivity
4) Time-consuming

# Discussion on Similarity and Differences of the Two Techniques

Similarities:

1) Both methods are used to evaluate a system's or product's dependability.
2) Both methods need the gathering and analysis of data.
3) The efficacy of process or design changes can be assessed using any of these two methods.

Differences:

1) A technique called reliability growth analysis is used to evaluate how much a system or product's reliability has increased over time. To do this, data on failures must be gathered, analysed, and process or design adjustments must be made to address the root causes of those failures. The objective is to reduce the number of failures over time in order to reach the target degree of reliability.
2) Contrarily, a reliability demonstration chart is a method used to show that a system or product satisfies a predetermined degree of reliability. This is accomplished by performing tests on a sample of the system or product and proving that it satisfies the required level of reliability.
3) A single test to show that a system or product satisfies a predetermined level of reliability is used in reliability demonstration charts, but reliability growth analysis often entails a continual process of monitoring, analysing, and increasing reliability.
4) While reliability demonstration charts are typically used towards the end of the development process to show that the product or system meets the required level of reliability, reliability growth analysis can be used throughout the product development process to identify and address reliability issues.

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
This lab was useful for learning about various analysis of integration test data using reliability assessment tools as well as how to use GitHub issues. The rubric/report structure offered a simple approach to structure the report, and the lab instructions were comprehensive enough to provide the team with guidance on how to finish the lab.
